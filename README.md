# n8n-nodes-truelime-docs

Custom n8n community node providing OCR & AI-driven document extraction via `limescape-docs`.

## Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> **New to building n8n nodes?** The fastest way to get started is with `npm create @n8n/node`. This command scaffolds a complete node package for you using the [@n8n/node-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/node-cli).

**To create a new node package from scratch:**

```bash
npm create @n8n/node
```

**Already using this starter? Start developing with:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts n8n with your nodes loaded and hot reload enabled.

## Versioning

We follow n8n’s hybrid versioning model:
- **Light versioning (minor updates)**: Inside a major implementation (e.g., V1), we list minor versions in the implementation file, e.g. `version: [1.21, 1.22, 1.23]`. Use `@version` in `displayOptions` to show/hide properties across minors.
- **Full versioning (major updates)**: The entry node (`nodes/LimescapeDocs/LimescapeDocs.node.ts`) extends `VersionedNodeType` and maps versions to implementations, e.g. `1.21/1.22/1.23 → V1`, `2.0/2.1 → V2`. Set `defaultVersion` to control the version used for new nodes.

This ensures existing workflows keep their saved minor version behavior, while major changes are isolated in a new implementation.

These are excellent resources to understand how to structure your nodes, handle different API patterns, and implement advanced features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, install the following on your development machine:

### Required

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v22 or higher) and npm
  - Linux/Mac/WSL: Install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - Windows: Follow [Microsoft's NodeJS guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
- **[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**

### Recommended

- Follow n8n's [development environment setup guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/node-development-environment/)

> [!NOTE]
> The `@n8n/node-cli` is included as a dev dependency and will be installed automatically when you run `npm install`. The CLI includes n8n for local development, so you don't need to install n8n globally.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create your own n8n community node package:

### 1. Create Your Repository

[Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from this template, then clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required dependencies including the `@n8n/node-cli`.

### 3. Explore the Examples

Browse the example nodes in [nodes/](nodes/) and [credentials/](credentials/) to understand the structure:

- Start with [nodes/Example/](nodes/Example/) for a basic node
- Study [nodes/GithubIssues/](nodes/GithubIssues/) for a real-world implementation

### 4. Build Your Node

Edit the `LimescapeDocs` node or add new providers as needed. See `credentials/LimescapeDocsApi.credentials.ts` and `nodes/LimescapeDocs/`.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to scaffold a completely new node package, use `npm create @n8n/node` to start fresh with the CLI's interactive generator.

### 5. Configure Your Package

Update `package.json` with your details:

- `name` - Your package name (must start with `n8n-nodes-`)
- `author` - Your name and email
- `repository` - Your repository URL
- `description` - What your node does

Ensure your node and credentials are registered in the `n8n` manifest and point to `dist/**` outputs.

### 6. Develop and Test Locally

Start n8n with your node loaded:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs `n8n-node dev` which:

- Builds your node with watch mode
- Starts n8n with your node available
- Automatically rebuilds when you make changes
- Opens n8n in your browser (usually http://localhost:5678)

You can now test your node in n8n workflows!

> [!NOTE]
> Learn more about CLI commands in the [@n8n/node-cli documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/node-cli).

### 7. Lint Your Code

Check for errors:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Auto-fix issues when possible:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### 8. Build for Production

When ready to publish:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles your TypeScript code to the `dist/` folder.

### 9. Prepare for Publishing

Before publishing:

1. **Update documentation**: Replace this README with your node's documentation. Use [README_TEMPLATE.md](README_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point.
2. **Update the LICENSE**: Add your details to the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file.
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your node works in different scenarios.

### 10. Publish to npm

Publish your package to make it available to the n8n community:

```bash
npm publish
```

Learn more about [publishing to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

### 11. Submit for Verification (Optional)

Get your node verified for n8n Cloud:

1. Ensure your node meets the [requirements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/):
   - Uses MIT license ✅ (included in this starter)
   - No external package dependencies
   - Follows n8n's design guidelines
   - Passes quality and security review

2. Submit through the [n8n Creator Portal](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes)

**Benefits of verification:**

- Available directly in n8n Cloud
- Discoverable in the n8n nodes panel
- Verified badge for quality assurance
- Increased visibility in the n8n community

## Available Scripts

This starter includes several npm scripts to streamline development:

| Script                | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`         | Start n8n with your node and watch for changes (runs `n8n-node dev`) |
| `npm run build`       | Compile TypeScript to JavaScript for production (runs `n8n-node build`) |
| `npm run build:watch` | Build in watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)                    |
| `npm run lint`        | Check your code for errors and style issues (runs `n8n-node lint`) |
| `npm run lint:fix`    | Automatically fix linting issues when possible (runs `n8n-node lint --fix`) |
| `npm run release`     | Create a new release (runs `n8n-node release`)                   |

> [!TIP]
> These scripts use the [@n8n/node-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/node-cli) under the hood. You can also run CLI commands directly, e.g., `npx n8n-node dev`.

## Troubleshooting

### My node doesn't appear in n8n

1. Make sure you ran `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Check that your node is listed in `package.json` under `n8n.nodes`
3. Restart the dev server with `npm run dev`
4. Check the console for any error messages

### Linting errors

Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix most common issues. For remaining errors, check the [n8n node development guidelines](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/).

### TypeScript errors

Make sure you're using Node.js v22 or higher and have run `npm install` to get all type definitions.
